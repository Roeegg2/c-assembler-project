assembler - add status variable to be set when error encountered and not write to any file

preassembler - set status variable and make that it wont write to file if theres error (add everything to an array and then write)

firstpass - .entry and .extern multiple files declaration

secondpass - convert to base64, 1.

errors - ent/ext errors with labelTable,

note to self:

additionally to commit message, go over code and try to make it nicer and more modular and tidy and less repetetive and good
