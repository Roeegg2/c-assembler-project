secondpass planning.

what should secondpass contain?

1. mapping and writing ext and ent files
2. replacing each of the unknown label addresses with its address/ reporting error if not found


match_extent_labeltable(){
	while (head != NULL)
		if (head.type is _ent)
			if (head->labelName is the same as a certain label in labelTable)
				labelTable[i]->type = head->type
			else
				error_handler() => .entry/.extern instruction for 
		else
			add label to labelTable, with address of 000000000001
}

write_to_ob_file(){
	// go over all of array, write it to file. if encountered label, find it in labelTable and replace its name with its address
	for (each element in array (could be iocImage could be dcImage))
		if (first character is not '0' or '1')
			address = find_label(...)
			if (address == 0)
				error
			else
				array[i] = address
		fprintf(...);
}

write_to_extent_file(){
	while (head != NULL)
		if (head type is _EXT)
			loop over the ic array and write all of the labels mentions
		else
			loop over labelTable
				if (label is .ent)
}

go over the head list and map each label
